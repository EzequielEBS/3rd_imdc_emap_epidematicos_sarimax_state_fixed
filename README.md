## 3. Libraries and Dependencies

**R** (used throughout `data_prep/` and `sarimax/src/`):

| Package | Used for |
|---|---|
| `tidyverse` (`dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr`, `readr`) | data wrangling |
| `lubridate`, `aweek` | date and epiweek handling |
| `zoo` | linear interpolation of missing ocean-climate index values |
| `runner` | rolling-window (3/6/9/12-month) covariate means |
| `sf`, `geobr` | municipality geometries/centroids, used to gap-fill island climate data |
| `forecast` | `Arima()` / `forecast()` — the SARIMAX engine |
| `scoringutils` | Weighted Interval Score (WIS) and interval-coverage scoring |
| `parallel`, `pbapply` | parallelized, progress-tracked grid search |
| `reticulate`, `data.table` | Python interop and fast I/O for the submission step |
| `dotenv` | loads the Mosqlimate API key from a local `.env` file (never hardcoded) |

**Python** (declared in `pyproject.toml`, only used via `reticulate` in `sarimax/src/sub_pred.r` to submit forecasts):

- `python = ">=3.10,<3.13"`
- `mosqlient==1.5.2` — Mosqlimate Predictions Registry client
- `epiweeks`, `python-dotenv`
- `jupyter`, `pmdarima` are declared but not currently invoked anywhere in this repository's code path — they are leftovers from the challenge template and can be removed if unused in your own workflow.

Install the R packages with, e.g., `install.packages(c("tidyverse","lubridate","aweek","zoo","runner","sf","geobr","forecast","scoringutils","pbapply","reticulate","data.table","dotenv"))`, and the Python side with `poetry install` (or `pip install mosqlient==1.5.2 epiweeks python-dotenv`).

## 4. Data and Variables

### Datasets

All disease and most covariate data are distributed by the Mosqlimate platform (Infodengue feed, probable cases — the `casprov`/`target_*` columns already reflect this); population comes from DATASUS.

- **Case data** — `raw_data/dengue.csv.gz`, `raw_data/chikungunya.csv.gz`: weekly probable case counts by municipality (`geocode`) and `epiweek`, with the official `train_1..4` / `target_1..4` split indicators used for both retrospective validation and the real submission (see Section 6).
- **Climate** — `raw_data/climate.csv.gz`: minimum/mean/maximum temperature, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, relative humidity, thermal range, and rainy-day count, by municipality and epiweek.
- **Environmental attributes** — `raw_data/environ_vars.csv.gz`: Köppen climate classification and biome, static per municipality.
- **Ocean-climate indices** — `raw_data/ocean_climate_oscillations.csv.gz`: ENSO, IOD, and PDO, indexed by epiweek (national scale, not municipality-specific).
- **Population** — `raw_data/datasus_population_2001_2025.csv.gz`: municipality population by year (2026 obtained by carrying the 2025 value forward — see `data_prep/merge_dengue.r`).
- **Regional-health mapping and shapefiles** — `raw_data/map_regional_health.csv` and the `shape_*.gpkg` files are read in by the merge scripts / available for spatial work but are **not** used as direct model covariates in the current pipeline; `sf`/`geobr` are used only in `data_prep/prep_climate.r` to fill climate gaps for island municipalities by borrowing their nearest mainland neighbor's series.
- `raw_data/forecasting_climate.csv.gz` is included but currently unused by any script.

### Pre-processing

Implemented in `data_prep/` (see `data_prep/README.md` for full detail), in order:

1. `prep_climate.r` — fills missing climate series for island municipalities.
2. `merge_dengue.r` / `merge_chikungunya.r` — left-joins case data with climate, environmental, ocean-climate, and population covariates.
3. `handle_na.r` — linearly interpolates the remaining gaps in ENSO/IOD/PDO.
4. `agg_data_uf.r` — sums cases and averages weather covariates from city to state (UF) level, and engineers 4/8/12/16-week lagged and 3/6/9/12-month rolling-mean versions of every weather covariate. Writes the final `processed_data/<disease>/<disease>_<UF>_agg.csv.gz` files used for modeling. Espírito Santo (ES) is excluded.

Inside model fitting itself, covariates are additionally standardized (z-scored) using the **training split's mean/SD only**, to avoid leaking information from the forecast window into the scaling — see `fit_sarimax()` in `sarimax/src/utils.r` (around the "Build & standardize regressor matrices" step) and `fit_sarimax_epiweek()` in `sarimax/src/fit.r`.

### Variable selection

Variable selection is fully automated per state/disease inside `run_model_selection()` (`sarimax/src/model_sel.r`), using only training-split rows at every filtering step to avoid leakage:

1. **`get_candidates()`** (`sarimax/src/utils.r`) enumerates the contemporaneous, lagged, and rolling-mean versions of the 8 base covariates (`temp_med_mean`, `precip_med_mean`, `rel_humid_med_mean`, `thermal_range_mean`, `rainy_days_mean`, `enso`, `iod`, `pdo`).
2. **`filter_low_variance()`** drops near-constant covariates (SD below a threshold).
3. **`filter_by_correlation()`** drops covariates whose absolute correlation with `log1p(cases)` is below a minimum threshold.
4. **Dimensionality reduction** — by default (`pca = TRUE`): **`pca_all()`** reduces the surviving local-weather covariates to the smallest number of principal components that explain ≥ 90% of variance in the most restrictive of the four CV folds. ENSO/IOD/PDO are deliberately excluded from the PCA and tested separately with **`filter_redundant_indices()`**, which keeps an index only if it still correlates with the response after the local-weather PCs' linear effect is removed — so ocean-climate signal isn't silently absorbed (or discarded) by the PCA. Candidate formulas use the leading 1..k PCs, with and without the surviving indices.
   An alternative, non-PCA path (`pca = FALSE`) is also implemented: **`select_best_per_variable()`** keeps only the best lag/rolling version of each base variable, and **`build_covariate_combinations()`** enumerates de-correlated covariate subsets (pairwise |correlation| below a threshold) up to a maximum size, from which a random sample is grid-searched.
5. **`run_grid_search()`** (`sarimax/src/utils.r`) cross-validates every candidate formula against a grid of SARIMAX `(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)` orders across the four train/target splits, and **`run_model_selection()`** picks the formula/order combination with the lowest mean cross-validated score (WIS by default).

## 5. Model Training

Each state and disease is modeled independently with `forecast::Arima()` (R package `forecast`), called through `fit_sarimax()` / `run_grid_search()` in `sarimax/src/utils.r` and orchestrated by `run_model_selection()` in `sarimax/src/model_sel.r`. The response is `log1p(cases)` (back-transformed with `expm1()` at forecast time and clipped at zero); the regressors are the PCA components / de-correlated covariate subset selected as described in Section 4, standardized using **training-split mean/SD only**.

**Hyperparameter search.** For every state and disease, and for every candidate covariate formula produced by the variable-selection step, `run_grid_search()` cross-validates a grid of SARIMAX `(p,d,q)(P,D,Q)` orders bounded by `max_order` (default `p <= 2, d <= 1, q <= 2, P <= 1, D = 0, Q <= 1`, seasonal period 52 weeks), fit with `method = "CSS-ML"` and `optim.method = "BFGS"`. Each (formula, order) combination is fit on each of the four `train_i` windows and scored against the matching `target_i` window (see Section 6) using `compute_metrics()` -- Weighted Interval Score (WIS), MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and empirical interval coverage at the 50/80/90/95% levels. `run_model_selection()` ranks every combination by mean cross-validated score (WIS by default, configurable via its `metric` argument) and keeps, per state and disease, the single formula/order pair with the lowest mean score. The full ranking is written to `sarimax/results/metrics/metrics_all_formulas_<disease>_<state>.csv`; the winners (one row per state) are written to `sarimax/results/metrics/best_wis_<disease>_all_states.csv` and are what `sarimax/src/fit.r` reads to know which formula/order to refit.

**Where the code lives and how to run it.** From the repository root, after the data-prep pipeline (Section 4) has produced `processed_data/<disease>/<disease>_<UF>_agg.csv.gz` for every state:

```r
# 1. Training / model selection for every state (and a few focal cities), both
#    diseases. Long-running (grid search x 26 states x 2 diseases). Safe to
#    interrupt and re-run: finished states are skipped via
#    results/concluded_states_*.csv.
source("sarimax/src/model_sel.r")

# 2. Refit the winning formula/order per state on all 4 train/target windows
#    and write one forecast CSV per state x window to results/preds/.
source("sarimax/src/fit.r")

# 3. Submit the forecasts to the Mosqlimate Predictions Registry.
source("sarimax/src/sub_pred.r")
```

See `sarimax/README.md` for a file-by-file breakdown and for instructions on calling `run_model_selection()` directly on a single state instead of running the full loop.

## 6. Data Usage Restriction

The IMDC rules require that the submission forecast -- covering EW41 of the current year through EW40 of the next year -- be produced using only data available up to EW25 of the current year. This repository encodes that rule directly in the data rather than leaving it to be remembered at modeling time: every `processed_data/<disease>/<disease>_<UF>_agg.csv.gz` file carries four pairs of boolean columns, `train_1..train_4` and `target_1..target_4` (supplied upstream by the Mosqlimate/Infodengue data feed and carried through unchanged by `data_prep/agg_data_uf.r`):

- **`train_1`-`train_3` / `target_1`-`target_3`** are three retrospective backtest windows. They exist purely to cross-validate the modeling pipeline against past seasons (this is what Section 5's grid search scores models on) and carry no submission-window restriction of their own -- the "future" data in these splits is already historical.
- **`train_4` / `target_4`** is the actual submission window, and the one the EW25->EW41/EW40 rule applies to. Empirically (verified directly against `processed_data/dengue/dengue_SP_agg.csv.gz`), `train_4` is `TRUE` for every epiweek up to and including EW25 of the current season, and `target_4` is `TRUE` for EW41 of the current year through EW40 of the next year -- exactly the window the challenge requires forecasts for, mapped from exactly the cutoff the challenge allows.

`fit_sarimax_epiweek()` (`sarimax/src/fit.r`) is the function used specifically for the `train_4`/`target_4` window (see the `if (train_id == "train_4")` branches in the dengue and chikungunya prediction loops near the bottom of `fit.r`, where it is called with `train_start`/`train_end` bounding the data through EW25 and `forecast_start = 202541`, `forecast_end = 202640` for the current run). Two mechanisms keep this leak-free:

1. **No future case data.** It fits `Arima()` only on `data[epiweek >= train_start & epiweek <= train_end, ]` -- rows after EW25 are never passed to the model, so no future case counts can influence the fit.
2. **No future covariate data.** The forecast horizon extends past the last epiweek for which real weather/ocean-index values exist (they haven't happened yet). Rather than requiring those unobserved values, `fit_sarimax_epiweek()` substitutes, for each forecast epiweek, that same epiweek number's value from **the previous year** (via the helper `prev_year_epiweek()`, which also handles the 52-vs-53-week-year edge case) as a seasonal-naive stand-in. This is a deliberate, documented modeling assumption appropriate for strongly seasonal climate variables -- not a leak, since the substituted value is itself historical data that was already available well before EW25.

## 7. Predictive Uncertainty

Prediction intervals come from `forecast::forecast()`'s bootstrap-simulation path (`bootstrap = TRUE`, `npaths = 1000`, set in both `fit_sarimax()` in `sarimax/src/utils.r` and `fit_sarimax_epiweek()` in `sarimax/src/fit.r`) rather than the default Gaussian/normal-theory intervals: 1,000 forecast paths are simulated from the fitted SARIMAX model and empirical quantiles of those paths are taken as the interval bounds. This is more robust to the non-normality introduced by the `log1p`/`expm1` response transform than a Gaussian approximation would be. Intervals are produced at four nominal coverage levels -- 50%, 80%, 90%, and 95% (the `levels` argument, default `c(50, 80, 90, 95)`) -- and reported as `lower_<level>`/`upper_<level>` columns alongside the point forecast `pred` in every `sarimax/results/preds/pred_<disease>_<UF>_target_<n>.csv` file; all bounds are clipped at zero after back-transforming with `expm1()`.

Interval calibration is checked, not just assumed: `compute_metrics()` (`sarimax/src/utils.r`) computes empirical coverage at each of the four levels (the fraction of held-out `target_i` observations that actually fall inside the predicted interval) every time a candidate model is cross-validated. Critically, model selection (Section 5) ranks candidates by mean Weighted Interval Score rather than by point-forecast error alone -- WIS is a proper score that rewards sharp *and* well-calibrated intervals simultaneously (see Reference 1 below), so the chosen model per state/disease is selected for probabilistic quality, not just point accuracy.
